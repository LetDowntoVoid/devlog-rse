Welcome to the first BrainFlatulance. This shall be the term I intend to use to explain what's going on in my mind.

For the project of course.

Now this would be the FIRST ever blog thing and this is where we are, and here are the prerequisites for you reader

:::warning
Remember, this is a devlog. Not a documentation. The main documentation will come out once I get close to release.

### SO,
# DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THIS DEV LOG IS UNHINGED AND INFORMAL I DO THIS TO KEEP MY MIND EMPTY OK?
:::

{/* truncate */}

# YOU GOTTA KNOW THESE THINGS BEFORE YOU READ THIS DEVLOG THING

## this is MY devlog. MINE
# OK? This is MY DEVLOG. letdowntovoid's YES MINE

That means I will have fun and I will write this to my humour. Of course I will have tags to separate content from good ones to
stupid ones to serious ones. My tags should define how good an topic is.

## This is NOT a documentation.

This is not a documentation of the project. This will just host my thoughts on what might happen and what is going on currently.
I don't like people who will refer to this as the documentation. No.
