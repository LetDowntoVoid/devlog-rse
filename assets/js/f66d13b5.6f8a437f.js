This shall be the term I intend to use to explain what\'s going on in my mind.\\n\\nFor the project of course.\\n\\nNow this would be the FIRST ever blog thing and this is where we are, and here are the prerequisites for you reader\\n\\n:::warning\\nRemember, this is a devlog. Not a documentation. The main documentation will come out once I get close to release.\\n\\n### SO,\\n# DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THIS DEV LOG IS UNHINGED AND INFORMAL I DO THIS TO KEEP MY MIND EMPTY OK?\\n:::\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n# YOU GOTTA KNOW THESE THINGS BEFORE YOU READ THIS DEVLOG THING\\n\\n### this is MY devlog. MINE\\n## OK? This is MY DEVLOG. letdowntovoid\'s YES MINE\\n\\nThat means I will have fun and I will write this to my humour. Of course I will have tags to separate content from good ones to\\nstupid ones to serious ones. My tags should define how good an topic is.\\n\\n## This is NOT a documentation.\\n\\nThis is not a documentation of the project. This will just host my thoughts on what might happen and what is going on currently.\\nI don\'t like people who will refer to this as the documentation. No.\\n\\n*This is a STATEMENT from VoidWorks Inc. Ltd. GmbH. [FOR LEGAL REASONS THIS IS A JOKE AND I AM NOT REGISTERED PLEASE DON\'T SUE ME]*\\n\\n## I have NO idea when this project will complete itself or what am I doing\\n\\nSeriously, I don\'t. I just came up with something impressive to impress the huzz B]\\n\\n## I would love every single bit of support from you people for this project \\\\<3\\n\\nNo seriously, I do. This project is something I am making while I learn so this will not be the best quality work. At all.\\nI would LOVE people joining me on this train and contribute with me on this project for the public. This is an abitiious project and you can join a development / miscellaneous server on Discord over at (this server)[https://discord.gg/F7yZJaRwS4].\\n\\nI am not a very good developer and I will make mistakes so if you can help me test it feel free to join me!\\n\\n\\n## This project WILL be open sourced and free for all! [and a small textwall]\\n\\nAs a developer who was on Roblox since 2016 (technically 2018 cause I actually stuck around after that), I loved Roblox. It gave me access to a massive community of some really REALLY good games.\\nI don\'t mean games that are cashgrabs I mean genuinely insanely fun games. I do not want to name any until I get their permission to but these games have allowed me to stick around on the platform and become a developer as well.\\nI understand that as we 25th of August, 2025, Roblox is recieving massive amounts of backlash with its course of actions on protecting their users and I have a feeling that the platform might not last. \\n\\nThis is why I am strongly moving forward with this project as well. I initially thought of this project back in 2020 but since I did not have much drive + I was not as good as I am today I was not ready to do this, but with recent circumstances I feel like I should\\nstart something about this. That is why I want to make this project. \\n\\n\\nThis project will be for everyone on the community and developers will *HOPEFULLY* be able to use the SDK to port over `rbxl` files into idk the game itself and run it as if its a standalone game. I have quite a bit to do and quite a bit to figure out but sure, I intend to do this over a few years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# That\'s a small sob story over;\\nbut that describes why I wish to make this project. \\n\\nHow will I do it?\\n\\nI have no <Spoiler>fucking</Spoiler> idea."}]}}')}}]);
